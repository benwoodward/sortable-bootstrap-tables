             description: 'These fist-sized
               bronze Roman artifacts found in France, Switzerland and Germany
               pose a fascinating problem for archaeologists: they just don’t
               have a clear purpose, but many are covered in symbols, some
               undecipherable and others relating to the Zodiac. But for all the
               speculation on their use, including that they may have been
               surveying instruments, some experts believe the Roman dodecahedra
               were merely decorative candlesticks.')

             description: 'There’s very little that we actually know for sure
               about the Phaistos Disc. It’s made of clay – check. It dates back to the second
               millenium B.C.E. – maybe. But its origin, meaning and purpose remain shrouded
               in mystery. Discovered in Crete, the disc is features i241 impressions of 45
               distinct symbols, some of which are easily identifiable as people, tools,
               plants and animals. But because nothing else like it from the same time period
               has ever been found, archaelogists haven’t been able to provide a meaningful
               analysis of its content.')

             description: 'Is the Voynich Manuscript evidence of a forgotten
               civilization, or merely an elaborate hoax? This handwritten book full of text
               that the world’s top cryptographers and codebreakers have never been able to
               decipher dates to the 15th century and was discovered in 1912 by book dealer
               Wilfrid M. Voynich. If it is a hoax, it’s incredibly convincing, given how
               fluidly the text was written and the fact that statistical analysis has
               revealed patterns similar to those found in natural languages')
